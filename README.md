# Community Repository - SEMOSS

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Community repo! This is where all new tickets for bug reports or feature requests should be submitted. In the “Issues” tab, you can view and contribute to existing tickets that have been submitted. Each of these is a comprehensive parent issue for a bug or feature that is then broken down into actionable tasks through their associated “sub-issues”, which are housed within the backend repos (Semoss, Monolith) or the frontend repo (semoss-ui).  

Below is an overview of best practices we encourage you to follow when submitting a ticket. Please search for an existing tickets before submitting a new one.

### Creating a new issue

When you are ready to submit a ticket, click on the green “New Issue” button in the top-right corner of the Issues page. There are two templates for new tickets, “Bug report” and “Feature request”.

1. Start by providing a descriptive title for the new feature or feature enhancement.
2. Next, fill in the main body of the ticket.
     - Replace the descriptive filler text for each section with the relevant content for your ticket.
     - If you are unsure about a section, delete the filler text and put down any questions or ideas that would help in fleshing out the section down the line.
     - Please include annotated screenshots in the “Additional context” section to illustrate the current state of the platform, where you envision the feature existing within the platform, and/or a rough mock-up of what the new feature might look like.
          - _**IMPORTANT: Please crop and redact all sensitive information from them prior to uploading so that uploaded images contain no user personal information (such as names, emails, and IDs),  platform URLs, or connection details (such as API keys)**_
     - Use the “Tasks” section to jot down action items needed to move the ticket forward, including the technical tasks you think are needed to implement the feature (if known).
3. Next, populate the right sidebar with the relevant information.
     - The Type field should be auto-populated with “Feature”, but please add it if not.
     - Assign the member(s) who will be working on the ticket, if known.
     - Please only use the “Labels” field to capture additional information that is NOT the ticket type, priority level, or status. The ticket type should go in the Type field (“Feature”); the priority level and status will be added under the Project section in the next step.
4. Click Create!
